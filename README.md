## Project Overview
ShipmentSure is a data-driven machine learning solution designed to predict whether a shipment will be delivered on time by analyzing supplier and order-related information. The project enhances supply chain operations by uncovering the factors that contribute to delivery delays and supporting proactive planning. Through comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model development, ShipmentSure aims to minimize delays and boost delivery reliability.

## Objective
To develop a reliable predictive model capable of accurately identifying on-time and delayed shipments using a combination of supplier, logistics, and product-level attributes.

## Problem Statement
Shipment delays can disrupt production timelines, affect revenue, and reduce customer trust. Manual monitoring methods are often slow, inconsistent, and prone to errors. ShipmentSure provides an automated, machine learning–based approach to anticipate delivery delays, enabling businesses to take timely corrective actions and optimize their supply chain performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- Google Colab for interactive development and experimentation
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Machine learning frameworks: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- 
## Dataset
The dataset comprises shipment and supplier details, featuring attributes such as shipment mode, product cost, item weight, warehouse block, and various customer-related indicators. Preprocessing steps involve cleaning missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical variables, and balancing the target classes using SMOTE to ensure robust model performance.
